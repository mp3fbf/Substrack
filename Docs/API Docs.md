Environment Configuration

Environment Variables

We will need to set up environment variables for secure keys and configuration settings, such as:
	•	Supabase:
	•	NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
	•	NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
	•	Clerk:
	•	NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
	•	CLERK_SECRET_KEY

These variables should be stored in a .env.local file and not committed to version control.

API Keys and Secrets

	•	Ensure you have signed up for Supabase and Clerk accounts to obtain the necessary API keys.
	•	For future integrations like Google Calendar API, OAuth credentials will be required.

API Usage Overview

Supabase Client Initialization

// src/lib/supabaseClient.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)

Clerk Provider Setup

// src/app/layout.tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      {children}
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}

Protecting Routes with Middleware

// src/middleware.ts
import { authMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default authMiddleware({
  publicRoutes: ['/'],
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
}

Notes

	•	While AI models are familiar with the general usage of these libraries, specific configurations and API usages unique to our project should be clearly defined.
	•	Always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
	•	Be cautious with API keys and secrets; never expose them publicly or commit them to a repository.

Conclusion

The primary APIs we’ll be using are Supabase and Clerk, along with Next.js API routes and i18next for internationalization. Providing links to their official documentation ensures that anyone working on the project has access to the necessary resources to configure and use these APIs effectively.

Is there a specific API or functionality you’d like to discuss in more detail or any additional APIs you believe we should include?
