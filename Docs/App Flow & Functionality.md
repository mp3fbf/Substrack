App Flow & Functionality Document

Imagine you’re using our new subscription tracking web app for the first time. When you visit the website, you’re greeted with a clean and minimalist landing page that reflects the design aesthetics of Apple and Airbnb. The page introduces the app’s core benefits, emphasizing how it helps you manage all your subscriptions in one place, avoid unexpected charges, and gain insights into your spending habits.

To get started, you click on the “Sign Up” button. The registration process is straightforward—you have the option to sign up using your email and password or simply use your Google account for quicker access. Let’s say you choose to sign up with your email. After entering your details and confirming your email address, you’re immediately logged into the app.

Upon signing in, you land on the Dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all your subscription management needs. The dashboard is thoughtfully designed with four main sections: Overview, Subscriptions, Analytics, and Settings.

In the Overview section, you get a snapshot of your subscription activities. At the top, there’s a friendly greeting with your name and a summary of your total monthly and annual spending on subscriptions. Just below that, you see upcoming renewals listed chronologically, so you know exactly which subscriptions are due next. This section helps you stay on top of your subscriptions without feeling overwhelmed.

Moving to the Subscriptions section, this is where you can manage all your individual subscriptions. The first time you visit this section, you’re prompted to add your subscriptions. You click on the “Add Subscription” button, and a modal window appears. Here, you can enter details like the service name (e.g., Netflix, Spotify), the cost, billing frequency (monthly, yearly), next billing date, and any notes you might want to include. You can also select the currency, choosing between USD and BRL, depending on your preference.

After adding a few subscriptions, they appear in a neatly organized list within the Subscriptions section. Each subscription entry displays the service logo (if available), the name, cost, next billing date, and a simple indicator showing how many days are left until the next renewal. If you need to make changes, you can click on a subscription to edit its details or delete it if you no longer use the service.

The Analytics section is where you can delve into your spending habits. Here, you’re presented with interactive charts and graphs that visualize your subscription expenses over time. For instance, there’s a pie chart showing the percentage of your spending across different services, and a line graph illustrating your monthly subscription costs throughout the year. This section helps you understand where your money is going and identify any areas where you might want to cut back.

Lastly, the Settings section allows you to customize your app experience. You can update your personal information, change your password, and adjust your notification preferences. By default, the app sends you email and in-app notifications three days before a subscription is due to renew. In the settings, you have the option to change the reminder period if you prefer more or less notice. You can also switch between English and Portuguese languages and select your preferred currency between USD and BRL.

One of the standout features of the app is the Calendar Integration. Although it’s a future enhancement, the groundwork is laid out in the app flow. In the Overview section, there’s a teaser for the Calendar view, informing you that soon you’ll be able to see all your subscription renewals plotted on a calendar for better visualization. This gives you something to look forward to as the app continues to evolve.

Throughout your navigation, the app maintains a consistent and intuitive user interface. Smooth transitions and responsive feedback make the experience pleasant and engaging. The top navigation bar provides quick access to all the main sections, and the responsive design ensures that whether you’re on a desktop or using your mobile browser, the app adapts seamlessly to your screen size.

If at any point you need assistance, there’s a Help option accessible from the footer. It leads you to a FAQ section where common questions are addressed. There’s also a Feedback form where you can send suggestions or report any issues you encounter. This ensures that you feel supported and that your input is valued as the app grows.

When you’re done using the app, you can simply log out by clicking on your profile icon in the top-right corner and selecting “Log Out.” The next time you log in, you’ll be brought back to your Dashboard, where all your information is saved securely, thanks to the robust backend powered by Supabase and Clerk’s authentication services.

In essence, the app provides a streamlined and user-friendly experience for managing your subscriptions. It focuses on essential functionalities like adding subscriptions, receiving reminders, and viewing analytics, all wrapped up in an aesthetically pleasing design. The app flow is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for you to navigate and utilize all the features without a steep learning curve.
