Project Requirement Document

Introduction

We are developing a premium, user-friendly web application designed to help individuals track and manage their various subscription services. The application aims to provide a centralized platform where users can easily monitor their subscriptions, receive reminders for upcoming renewals, and gain insights into their subscription expenses through analytics. With a focus on a pleasant user experience inspired by brands like Apple, Vercel, and Airbnb, the app will combine functionality with an eye-catching design.

Problem

In today’s digital age, individuals often subscribe to multiple services such as streaming platforms, apps, and software tools. Keeping track of all these subscriptions—along with their renewal dates and costs—can be challenging. This can lead to:
	•	Missed cancellations resulting in unwanted charges
	•	Difficulty in budgeting due to unnoticed recurring expenses
	•	Lack of awareness of overall spending on subscriptions

There is a need for a simple yet effective solution to manage and monitor these subscriptions in one place.

	•	Calendar Integration: Visualize subscription renewals on an in-app calendar.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Enjoy a pleasant and engaging user experience with a design inspired by leading brands.

By focusing on these core features, the app aims to simplify subscription management and help users make informed financial decisions.
